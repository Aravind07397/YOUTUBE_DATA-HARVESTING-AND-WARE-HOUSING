# YOUTUBE_DATA-HARVESTING-AND-WARE-HOUSING
This project utilizes Python and the YouTube Data API to collect data from multiple YouTube channels, including channel IDs, view counts, and comments. The collected data is then stored in a MySQL database for further analysis and visualization. A Streamlit web app is also implemented to showcase the data in a user-friendly format.
